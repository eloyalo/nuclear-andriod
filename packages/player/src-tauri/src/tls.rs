//! Shared reqwest client construction.
//!
//! reqwest 0.13 verifies server certificates with `rustls-platform-verifier`,
//! which on Android doesn't use webpki at all: it calls the system's
//! `X509TrustManager` over JNI and panics ("Expect rustls-platform-verifier to
//! be initialized") unless the app hands it a JVM `Context` before the first
//! handshake. Initializing it would also mean shipping the verifier's Kotlin
//! component inside the APK, so on Android we skip the platform verifier
//! entirely and hand reqwest a rustls config with the webpki roots compiled in.
//! See ANDROID_PLAYBACK.md §2.
//!
//! Everything that talks HTTPS from Rust should start from here.
